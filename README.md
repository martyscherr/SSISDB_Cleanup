# SSISDB_Cleanup

This project details how I manage my SQL Server Integration Services (SSISDB) Database.  This effort came out of a need to purge old log data out of the SSISDB database on a very busy SSISDB Database.  I use a TRY/CATCH exception block and explicit transactions to manage the deletes from the tables so that I wasn't affecting current SSIS processing and also manages the Transaction Log file size.   

NOTE:  Please use this code cautiously on your environment.  I encourage you to use Activity Monitor or SQL Profiler to monitor for excessive locking or blocking SQL.  Based on my extensive use of this process I have not experienced any significant locking or blocking but that could vary in your environment.

I have included some SQL queries in this solution that will help you track your Tables and Indexes involved in the process.

Files Included:
SSISDB_drop_foreign_keys.sql - Foreign Keys that I drop while executing the pruning process to improve the performance.  The reason I do this is that many of the Foreign Keys in the SSISDB database use a CASCADE DELETE option which tends to be slow in performance.   Make sure to create the foreign keys once the process is completed.  

sp_SSISDB_prune_data.sql - Stored Procedure that executes the data pruning process

There are two Tables used by the sp_SSISDB_prune_data.sql.  These tables are created in this stored procedure and are re-created each time the process runs.  By default these tables will be created in the SSISDB Database.
Table: dbo.SSISDB_prune_data_error - captures any errors generated by the TRY/CATCH exception block
Table: dbo.SSIS_prune_data_log - logs the progress the stored procedure: sp_SSISDB_prune_data

SSISDB_create_foreign_keys.sql - Creates the Foreign Key Constraints dropped during the pruning process is completed

SSISDB_sp_updatestats.sql - updates the Statistics on the SSISDB database after the pruning process is completed


DBA_SSISDB_prune_data.sql - Creates a SQL Job Script to execute the above SQL in this order below.  You will have to setup a Job Schedule and I recommend setting a Job Notification Email on Job Completion for SQL Job Monitoring.
Job Steps execute the SQL in the following order:
1. SSISDB_drop_foreign_keys.sql
2. sp_SSISDB_prune_data.sql
3. SSISDB_create_foreign_keys.sql
4. SSISDB_sp_updatestats.sql
